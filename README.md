## Brief (as originally given by client)

We are seeking an automated programme for writing junior doctors' rotas in anaesthesia. The programme would need account for
1. Request input data from individuals concerning annual leave and study leave
2. Account for individuals annual leave, bank holiday and study leave allocations
3. Accommodate individualised working patterens with regard to days and hours worked e.g Full time, Less than full time (0.8, 0.6 WTE).
4. Safe and Sustainable working practices which conform to junior doctor working time regulations.
5. Usable for bespoke rotas for 3 month blocks - trainees often only rotate for short periods of time to hospitals before moving again to another hospital base.
6. Create a fully staffed on call rota whilist permitting sufficient time for daytime training for 365 days per year.

With increased work flexibility, the writing of rotas has become increasingly complex and time consuming. This has become non-sustainable as a consultant role and many hospitals how now created 'fixed' rota patterns. Fixed rota patterns remove flexibility in terms of leave and weekends off, impairing work-life balance for doctors in training. This is impacting trainee doctor wellbeing which has already been strained during the current pandemic.

If successful, this programme could be utilised as a format throughout the hospital as well as adopted by other hospitals in region and around the country who have similar issues. This would avoid widespread adoption of fixed, inflexible rota patterns
